# History Bot 1.0
<img align="right" src="historybotwebsite.png">

A history bot is a device that responds to user interaction with a visual, mechanical or aural response.
The history bot 1.0 is built using a Raspberry Pi 3B+.


"History Bots" is an upper division History class offered at Centre College during Centre Term, an intensive sixteen day term offered in January between long terms. 
The class will be taught for the first time in January 2020.

I have taught CentreTerm classes focused on student group work, including production of video games and podcast episodes.

If you are a Centre student, feel free to come and see me in Crounse 424 or [email](mailto:john.harney@centre.edu) me.

**You do not need to know _anything_ about coding or computer science to take this class, do well, and have fun!**

## What will we do in this class?

Students will organize into small groups to create a robot version - or robot adequate representation - of a historical figure that will be able to carry on a conversation with someone who played no role in building it. 
All groups will likely have technology in common, running their history bot off a raspberry pi and using a microphone and speaker to communicate. 
I want to hear from Napoleon on why he invaded Russia, or from Ada Lovelace on her work creating algorithms, or from a composite Incan individual based on primary sources from the 1500s what life was like before and during the European arrival.

There are important questions here about how we understand history and how we choose to tell it. 
Biographies are extremely popular among general readers; what do we gain and what might we lose from focusing on individuals? 
How does one use biographical information to tell different types of historical narratives? 
We will look at historical biography independently of our work on the history bots, but those discussions will influence the project work.

Finally, we are going to be creative! What will this history bot looke like? 
3D printed, crafted from wood, influenced by an art project? 
Original ideas are encouraged.

## Course Goals
Students who take "History Bots" will:
- develop skills in historical research, gaining experience in gathering different sources and choosing which materials to use
- produce a work of history (in this case the "history bot") that engages with concepts of historical argument and narrative with a focus on a broader audience
- work in small groups to plan and execute a clearly articulated project, outlining student responsibilities and milestones towards the final product


### History

The class is focused on the popularity and usefulness of biography in historical writing. 
The field has moved away, in the last half century, from the history of "great men," but historical biographies are still among the most popular type of history book. 
Why is this? 
Student work, in creating a history bot, will be primarily an act of biography. 
What are the advantages and disadvantages of a biographical approach?

Students will write a short research paper (of 1,800 to 2,000 words) on their group's chosen historical figure, and will run presentations discussing ongoing project work.

### Coding

Having a background in coding for this class certainly will not hurt, but is not necessary. 
The instructor knows enough Python to be dangerous and little beyond that; we will educate ourselves in ethical use of open source software shared by its creators.
