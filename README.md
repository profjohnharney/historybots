# History Bot 1.0
<img align="right" src="historybotwebsite.png">

A history bot is a device that responds to user interaction with a visual, mechanical or aural response.
The history bot 1.0 is built using a Raspberry Pi 3B+.

This project is offered as a suggestion to fellow educators who are interested in bringing a project like this into the classroom.
I work as an historian looking to bring technological skills and interactions with technology into the classroom. 
More information on the History Bot 1.0, including a recap of my own experiences teaching a class using this project, can be found in Documentation.

I have endeavoured to be clear in laying out the basic steps involved in creating a History Bot, but independent research is often inevitable.
If you succeed in creating this History Bot you will learn plenty along the way, and will have the tool to start making your own projects if you choose.

I hope this was helpful! Comments are welcome. You can read more about me [here](http://www.profjohnharney.com) and you can contact me on twitter at [@profjohnharney](http://www.twitter.com/profjohnharney).

## Some brief information

### What you need to make the History Bot
- a Raspberry Pi (I have used a Zero and a 3B+)
- a power supply
- an SD card (8GB is more than enough, and you can redeploy for other projects)
- an interactive button
- a speaker (this project uses a USB speaker)
- an led and an appropriate resistor
- connectors, such as jumper wires
- some kind of housing for the bot; this project used a 3D printer to fabricate IBM's TJ Bot design

### My goals in teaching the History Bot
- to introduce students to practical use of coding, without the need for prior experience
- to encourage students to be creative in their research of and presentation of historical topics
- to give students experience and practice in working with others in a small group

### I have no experience in coding, can I do this?
YES, though you want to give yourself some lead time to work through some basic programming ideas and hardware scenarios.
If you have never done anything like this before, be prepared for what seem like minor tasks sometimes taking a while to complete, especially if you are teaching or working on other projects.

However, the feeling you get when you solve a problem, or learn a new skill?
I have rarely had so much fun doing my job.
And I love my job.
