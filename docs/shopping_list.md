# History Bot 1.0 Shopping List

You have many options when it comes to buying these components. I recommend [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com) and [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com). Links below are to Adafruit listings.

There are a couple of wrinkles in this list. If you do not care about having an LED turning on to indicate the History Bot is speaking, you can skip the LED and resistor. In this case, as long as you get the quick connect wires for the arcade button, you would also not need jumper wires. Though they are INCREDIBLY useful when it comes to learning how to use a Raspberry Pi.
