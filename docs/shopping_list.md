# History Bot 1.0 Shopping List

You have many options when it comes to buying these components. 
I recommend [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com) and [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com). Links below are to Adafruit listings.

There are a couple of wrinkles in this list. 
If you do not care about having an LED turning on to indicate the History Bot is speaking, you can skip the LED and resistor. 
With connectors, leds and resistors you will find you are ordering more than you "need" for this specific project.
But you will always want plenty of those things and spares are extremely useful. 
It may also prove to be the basis of a little Dig Hum hardware lab!
