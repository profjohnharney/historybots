# History Bot 1.0 Shopping List

You have many options when it comes to buying these components. 
I recommend [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com) and [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com). Links below are to Adafruit listings.

There are a couple of wrinkles in this list. 
If you do not care about having an LED turning on to indicate the History Bot is speaking, you can skip the LED and resistor. 
With connectors, leds and resistors you will find you are ordering more than you "need" for this specific project.
But you will always want plenty of those things and spares are extremely useful. 
It may also prove to be the basis of a little Dig Hum hardware lab!

Linking up the arcade button using jumper wires and alligator clips is pretty awkward, but it will work. 
You might want to consider investing in a soldering iron setup - and investing the time required to learn to solder - if you are thinking of taking this work further and creating more durable projects.

Finally, although you do not need tools for this project, you should give some thought to what a simple tool set would look like.
You cannot go wrong with a pair of needle-nosed pliers and some electrical tape.
