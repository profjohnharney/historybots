# History Bot 1.0 Documentation

This folder contains basic information on how to:
- set up a raspberry pi from scratch
- hook up the various hardware pieces for the History Bot
- get a history bot up and running!

Also note that each history bot in the examples directory is named according to its historical subject; e.g. reagan_bot, ali_bot. The `historybot.py` code in the home directory of this repository will not work "out of the box" but serves as a template to use to create history bots of your own. Initially this is as simple as copying the file into a directory with .mp3 or .wav files already present.
