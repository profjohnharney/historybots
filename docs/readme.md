# History Bot 1.0 Documentation

This folder contains basic information on how to:
- set up a raspberry pi from scratch
- hook up the various hardware pieces for the History Bot
- get your RPi to work with the USB speaker if it is giving you trouble

More information can be found at [my website](http://www.profjohnharney.com), including discussion of my experiences teaching with the bot.
