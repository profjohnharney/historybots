# Setting up the hardware  

At this point, you should have a Raspberry Pi that can boot up into the Raspbian OS. 
You can find information on how to do this [here](https://github.com/profjohnharney/historybots/blob/working_towards_1.0/docs/set_up_rpi.md).

## RPi Hardware Basics

The beauty of the Raspberry Pi lies in its GPIO pins. 
These pins allow you to use the Pi as an interface between software and hardware. 
There is huge potential here, but for our purposes the pins will do three simple things:
- light up an LED that signals the History Bot is "working"
- confirm whether a button has been pressed or not
- light up another LED inside the button

You do not want to just throw the Pi around or to be too careless with its GPIO pins; but it is fairly robust. 
Do not be too scared.
Just remember that each connection needs two pins: one that is providing current and one that is grounded.
